## Voice & Tone

- **Adjectives:** Professional, Reliable, Clear, Efficient, Arabic-first, Utility-focused
- **Tone:** Professional and clear Arabic-first tone for warehouse and distribution management.

### Messaging pillars

- Turn your phone into a complete warehouse management system — invoices, payments, customer tracking, and reports
- Real-time team collaboration with role-based permissions — ownership, management, and employee access levels
- Arabic-first RTL experience designed for the Egyptian market with intuitive navigation and quick actions

### Vocabulary

- **Avoid:** English-only navigation in the Arabic interface, Left-to-right layout elements that break RTL flow, Complex financial jargon without Arabic equivalents, Fake or placeholder Arabic business names in demos

## Imagery

- **Style:** Clean mobile UI screenshots on light background. Flat illustrations for empty states. Status-colored icon badges (green = paid, orange = partial, red = debt). The app uses a Material 3 design system with moderate shadows and elevated card surfaces.
- **Subjects:** Dashboard with summary cards (today's sales, product count, total debts, customer count), Product management screens with inventory tracking and stock status, Invoice creation flow with customer selection, product picker, and payment method, Customer detail screens with transaction history and debt tracking, Team management and role-based permission screens
- **Treatment:** Border-radius: 14px on controls, 24px on cards. Clean white surfaces with green accent touches. Flat 2D interface with Material elevation for depth. Icons use outlined Material style (stroke width 2.5).
- **Avoid:** Dark mode or black backgrounds — the app is light-themed, Aggressive gradients except for the welcome/onboarding screen, Photography or photo-realistic imagery
